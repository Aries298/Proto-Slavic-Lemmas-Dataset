# Proto-Slavic-Lemmas-Dataset
# About the Dataset
The dataset consists of two columns:
Column1 - containing words in Proto-Slavic
Column2 - containing words in Polish

All entries are single words.

All the data has been scraped from the Wiktionary site:
https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Proto-Slavic_lemmas
The scraped words were merged together with Old Polish and then for every word the most fitting variant was chosen.
